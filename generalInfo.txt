There are three main areas to this Project:

GatherData:
    In this section, there is code present for data collection.
    This data is stored for use in Variants.

Variants:
    In this section, we have data regularization, model building, model
    training, and model testing
    Order of files in a variant Directory:
        to_excel
        data_prep
        build_SKL_models
        model_scores
        tf_models

EMNA-TC-ML:
    Here the models are hybridized into EMNA-TC and tested on new examples
    Order of files:
        main_... file. If it produces Excel files, then this stage is complete
            if not, replace specifics in to_excel.py with that of the 'main' file just used

Models:
    In Variants models are created and named numerically, rather than by
    model type. Models 1, 5, 7, 14, 15, 18, 21, 22 are used in EMNA-TC-ML
