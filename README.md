# EMNA-TC-ML-Hybrid
Code used in project researching a hybrid of EMNA-TC with machine learning models

This was a project at the University of Prince Edward Island conducted by:
Supervisor: Dr. Antonio Bolufe-Rohler
Student: Jordan Luke

For this code, the models included involve Scikit-Learn model types:
Fabian Pedregosa, Ga ̈el Varoquaux, Alexandre Gramfort, Vincent Michel, BertrandThirion, Olivier Grisel, Mathieu Blondel, Peter Prettenhofer, Ron Weiss, VincentDubourg,  et  al.   Scikit-learn:   Machine  learning  in  python.Journal  of  machinelearning research, 12(Oct):2825–2830, 2011.

and TensorFlow Keras models:
Martın Abadi, Ashish Agarwal, Paul Barham, Eugene Brevdo, Zhifeng Chen, CraigCitro, Greg S. Corrado, Andy Davis, Jeffrey Dean, Matthieu Devin, Sanjay Ghe-mawat,  Ian  Goodfellow,  Andrew  Harp,  Geoffrey  Irving,  Michael  Isard,  YangqingJia, Rafal Jozefowicz, Lukasz Kaiser, Manjunath Kudlur, Josh Levenberg, Dande-lion Man ́e, Rajat Monga, Sherry Moore, Derek Murray, Chris Olah, Mike Schus-ter, Jonathon Shlens, Benoit Steiner, Ilya Sutskever, Kunal Talwar, Paul Tucker,Vincent Vanhoucke, Vijay Vasudevan, Fernanda Vi ́egas, Oriol Vinyals, Pete War-den,  Martin  Wattenberg,  Martin  Wicke,  Yuan  Yu,  and  Xiaoqiang  Zheng.
