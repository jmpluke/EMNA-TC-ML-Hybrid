# EMNA-TC-ML-Hybrid
Code used in project researching a hybrid of EMNA-TC with machine learning models

This was a project at the University of Prince Edward Island conducted by:
Supervisor: Dr. Antonio Bolufe-Rohler, 
Student: Jordan Luke

This project was done as part of a Research Project course, for marks, from the University of Prince Edward Island.

For this code, the models included involve Scikit-Learn model types [1] and TensorFlow Keras models [2,3].

Strategies for building these were learned in the process of this project through Pluralsight courses [4,5].
